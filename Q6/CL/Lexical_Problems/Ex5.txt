5. Define a regular expression for all strings that represent financial quantities in American notation.
Examples:
$**2,345.67     $12,452,183.16      $****12     $**0
These have a leading dollar sign ($), an optional string of asterisks (* - used on checks to discourage
a fraud), a string of decimal digits, and an optional fractional part consisting of a decimal point (.)
and two decimal digits. The string of digits to the left of the decimal point may consist of a single
zero (0). Otherwise it must not start with a zero. If there are more than three digits to the left of
the decimal point, groups of three (counting from the right) must be separated by commas (,).

'$' ('*')* (0 | ( D0 | D0 D | D0 D D) ( (',' D D D)* )? ('.' D D)? )


D = [0 - 9]
D0 = [1 - 9]
